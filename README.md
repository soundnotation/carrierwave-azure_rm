# Carrierwave::AzureRM

Microsoft Azure Storage blob support for [CarrierWave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave).

Heavily inspired by @unosk [carrierwave-azure](https://github.com/unosk/carrierwave-azure) gem, which seems to be no longer maintained.

Uses new [azure-storage](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ruby) sdk to support [ARM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'carrierwave-azure_rm'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

First configure CarrierWave with your Azure storage credentials

see [Azure/azure-storage-ruby](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ruby#via-code)

```ruby
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.azure_storage_account_name = 'YOUR STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME'
  config.azure_storage_access_key = 'YOUR STORAGE ACCESS KEY'
  config.azure_storage_blob_host = 'YOUR STORAGE BLOB HOST' # optional
  config.azure_container = 'YOUR CONTAINER NAME'
  config.asset_host = 'YOUR CDN HOST' # optional
end
```

To configure retry parameters in case of azure failure:

```ruby
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  # ...
  config.retry_count = 'RETRY COUNT' # optional - Set the retry count. Default is 3
  config.retry_interval = 'RETRY INTERVAL' #optional - Set the interval between retry in seconds. Default is 30 seconds
  # ...
end
```

And then in your uploader, set the storage to `:azure_rm`

```ruby
class ExampleUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  storage :azure_rm
end
```

## Private blobs
If your container access policy is set to private, carrierwave-azure_rm can automatically
return signed urls on the files. Enable auto_sign in the configuration:

```ruby
config.auto_sign_urls = true
config.token_expire_after = 3600 # optional - Set the expire time of the url to 3600 seconds. Default is 1800 seconds 
```

If you wish a newly created container to be initialized with a specific access_level you can set the following in
your config:

```ruby
config.public_access_level = 'private' # optional - possible values are blob, private, container
```

This config is only required if your container does not exist and you want it to be configured automatically.
